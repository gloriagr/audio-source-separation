# Audio Source Separation using Low Latency Neural Network
This reposiory contains the code for our course project for Deep Learning on Computational Accelerators (236605) at Technion - Israel Institute of Technology.
We have used the implementation of the paper "[Monoaural Audio Source Separation Using Deep
Convolutional Neural Networks](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fede/f8eedef76692d805a6a3380159a95b79b4de.pdf)",
by [SConsul](https://github.com/SConsul/audio-source-separation) and attempted to improve their results.
